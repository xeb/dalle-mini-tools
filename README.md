# dalle-mini-tools

A collection of tools for generating [dalle-mini](https://github.com/borisdayma/dalle-mini) and [diffuers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) images (e.g. [Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/src/diffusers/pipelines/stable_diffusion/pipeline_stable_diffusion.py))

## Purpose
The goal of this project is primarily research and building tooling around modern, public clip-guided diffusion methods and models.

## Installation & Usage
Install the dependencies, then try out the CLI. Once installed, try `python dalle_mini_tools/generate_stable_diffusion.py --help` for more.

Important: Dependencies are specified in `pyproject.toml`. If you update the dependencies, run `poetry update` to update the lockfile `poetry.lock` and commit the changes to these two files. This is how poetry maintains the project's virtual environment.

There are two ways to install:

1. Using pip
1. Using poetry

Once installed, if everything runs OK, you should get images in an `output` directory. Like:

![dalle-mini Samples](assets/dalle-mini-samples.png)

### pip install

```sh
# create a virtual environment with Python 3.10, and activate it

# install the project using the state of the code in the `main` branch
# you can replace `main` with any branch name or commit sha
python -m pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/xeb/dalle-mini-tools.git@main

# install the project using the current state of your local code
python -m pip install /path/to/dalle-mini-tools

# Generate an image from text
python generate.py "a man at a computer trying to generate images"
```

### poetry install

```sh
# # If you installed poetry 1.1.x before, uninstall first
# curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 - --uninstall

# Install poetry 1.2.x preview
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 - --preview

# Create virtual env for this project, install requirements
poetry install

# Enter virtual environment
poetry shell

# Generate an image from text
python generate.py "a man at a computer trying to generate images"

# Alternatively, rather than enter the venv with `poetry shell`, run directly:
poetry run python generate.py --help
```

## What is in this project?

To date, the project contains:

* __`generate.py`__ is a command-line interface for generating images using the dalle-mini model. This has no dependencies.
* __`generate_stable_diffusion.py`__ is a command-line interface for generating images using [Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/src/diffusers/pipelines/stable_diffusion/pipeline_stable_diffusion.py). This has no dependencies.
* __`sitegen.py`__ is a static website generator that uses `templates/template.html` to create index pages per the specified `output_dir` so you can upload results to a webserver
* __`server.py`__ is a Flask web server to host requests. This depends the `request.py` library and on having a `worker.py` running since requests are queued into an SQS queue.
* __`worker.py`__ is a worker process that listens to a SQS queue and then runs the model (via `generate.py`)
* __`request.py`__ is a command-line tool (and library used by `server.py`) for sending requests to the SQS queue. The server depends on this.

## Development notes

- Autoformat python files with `poetry run make lint`
- Installs `ipywidgets` to avoid a tqdm error: `AttributeError: 'tqdm_notebook' object has no attribute 'disp'`
- Installs `tokenizers` 0.11.6 to support running on Apple silicon (0.12.x isn't working)
- You may need to `pip install --upgrade "jax[cuda]" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html` to get NVIDIA GPU support; will see how to do this in Poetry later

More to come...
